* **KBS Spies and Assassins**
	> **Topic: _Development Operations for Creative Agencies
Agency-style operations at startup-inspired scale_ **

	> Mike Dory, Executive Director of Technology
Rick Garcia, Director of Development Operations

	> Those who work in the field of creative technology are used to fast-paced environments that see constant change — we know that the tools we use and the ways we will use them are continuously evolving every day. Our technology-focused agencies no longer build just microsites and promotional pages, but now often include the architecture, development, deployment, and continued maintenance of entire global websites and enterprise-scale web stacks. This usually means managing a variety of active projects across the team, often with overlapping schedules, and on a host of different technology stacks. How can we as an industry keep developing new creative works at this pace, yet continue to deliver the high-quality experiences that our clients and their users have come to expect?

	> Development Operations (commonly referred to as “DevOps”) is a concept that has been gaining mass adoption in the startup world over the past few years, and focuses on automating our infrastructure to scale up to handle enterprise-grade traffic while also continuously integrating code and configurations multiple times per day. Ultimately, it’s a way to ensure system stability, stack scalability, and overall human happiness, all while conserving resources.

	> In this talk, the kbs+ Spies & Assassins technology team will explain what DevOps is, what it means to our industry, and how you can take a big leap forward with these new tools and practices. We’ll include a quick tour of the relevant landscape, and show a few examples of how it’s proven invaluable for our own client projects.

* Innocean and Neuroscience: 

	> Could the key to unlocking genuine connections between consumers and brands lie in understanding a single neurochemical called oxytocin? Creative agency INNOCEAN is using the latest science to identify why trust, empathy and connection are rooted deep in our mammalian brains and what this means for the future of brands. 

	> INNOCEAN USA's VP of Digital & Engagement Strategy, **Uwe Gutschow** , will explore the relationship between oxytocin and consumer’s ability to trust and connect with brands. Uwe will explain why companies that are able to raise our oxytocin levels will prosper by diving deep into the world of neuroscience, economics, biology and psychology. The discussion will also examine the moral implications of tailoring communications to maximize oxytocin release and the possibility of using it as a metric for success in the future. In addition, Uwe will discuss how INNOCEAN has used this science to tailor campaigns for clients including Hyundai.

* **Rachel Law**, Interface Foundry, solo talk

* DDB and McDonalds
	> a session with McDonalds that would highlight how the megabrand activates on new platforms, like Instagram and Spotify, as well as its own in-store WiFi network, considered ahead of the curve. Since McDonalds was one of the first paid sponsors of Instagram/Spotify, they have a wealth of data, insights, etc that could be shared with your audience in a very visual and interactive session.

## Mike Dogiovani - CreateTech 2014 Wearables workshop

#### Normal Running Time: 1:30-2:00
#### Ideal number of participants
- Max of 15, to be broken up into teams of 3-4. 
- The couch based area you mentioned might be good for the style of talk I'm thinking. 
- There would be no problem with trimming this down to 10 for space concerns, maybe we could do it twice if there’s enough interest.
 
#### Summary of workshop, description of activities, outcomes or results

The workshop will begin with a talk about the current state of modern wearable hardware and software. This will include both general purpose wearables, like smartwatches, and more focused wearables like fitness bands and custom hardware. We will discuss what works and what has failed across consumer oriented wearables in the past 4 years. The goal is to give attendees an understanding of how to approach designing an experience that ties into modern consumer wearables.

The initial discussion will be followed by a design exercise where small teams will come up with a simple wearable product that embraces some of the principles previously discussed.  This can be new hardware or just software designed to run on an existing wearable platform. We will have a variety of wearables to get some hands-on time with as well as 3D printed mock ups of unavailable devices like the Apple Watch. Attendees will be provided with a suggested hardware and software platform to jumpstart their creativity if they aren't feeling particularly creative that day.

The main goal of this activity is to show off how hardware will often dictate how your software works and what interactions a user will want to have and allow the atttendees to apply some of the knowledge already gained
                The workshop will conclude with a discussion on the results of the design exercises as we talk through each product.
 
#### Materials needed
 - A comfortable sitting area that fosters collaboration.
 
####A/V Technology needed

#### References or presentation history
-Speaker at Wearables Dev Con 2014
- Speaker at Screens 2013

- Developed for and used numerous wearables over the past 3 years.

#### Questions
