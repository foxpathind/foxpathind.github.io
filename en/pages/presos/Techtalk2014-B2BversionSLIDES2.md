#Some remarks on B2B (Financial Services)

Eventually I think it will break down to specific categories of funds like real estate, commodities, energy, private equity, etc. There's a continual cry for education around alts. Emerging markets is also a happening category right now and that also lends itself to content marketing. I understand that lots of active money is shifting to ETFs but I don't have any real experience with what's happening there. But that also is generally about more finely targeted niches so showing off your knowledge works for them as well.

Here's a good sample of a microsite from Alger focused on a topic. I suspect they are going to roll out one topic at a time and have a 1-3 year plan for this for building on this base. The video shows the sophistication level that has emerged just in the past 3-5 years. 
http://www.thinkfurtheralger.com/auto/?utm_source=ii&utm_medium=banner&utm_content=logo&utm_campaign=med

> That movement toward more sophisticated rolling campaigns focused on content marketing

(away from the one-shot campaign like we always did at Wechsler) seems to be taking root. 

I think BlackRock was the first to successfully do it with this campaign which I think they touted as having a 5-year plan:
http://www.pinterest.com/pin/42150946483651719/

That's my pinterest page, btw, where I try to collect campaign sites when I have the time. I try to go through each issue of Institutional Investor and collect the campaigns.

Oppenheimer got a shitload of -- I think undeserved -- credit for their "Globalize Your Thinking" campaign. They made a separate site to build on over the course of year. I think the marketing manager for Oppenheimer was just really good at self-promotion. It was a pretty nice site and organized well but I suspect there was nothing there to really keep people coming back. I bet their overall return rates were not good.

Here at Addison, they did a really nice job with a permanent content marketing site/campaign for Fitch called the Why Forum. They set it up for Fitch, did some events, an intro video and a set of style guides to let Fitch add content themselves. 

There are a couple of levels of video production speced out ranging from multi-camera to smart phone via Skype. It's a nice effort that really allows for a perpetual campaign.

I also think the marketers are getting better at analytics and a/b testing and the like. But I'm not sure. We still get brought in for the onset of a campaign only. And don't get me wrong, there's still a lot of crap going on. Just look at my Pinterest page.

But there's a lot of sophistication happening in the web presentation too. Here's a page that Kristen designed and Tradeweb is about to roll out. Marketers right now really love all the bells and whistles (sometimes whether it communicates or not).

#CreateTech’s theme: No edges: humans machines environments

CreateTech tackles investigates this theme in three ways:


---

#CreateTech’s theme: No edges: humans machines environments

**“Ambient intelligence”: people, places, things**
The starting point is the emerging internet of everything, an ever-more-connected world of people, places and things: Wearable technology; smart appliances; connected cars; homes and environments. The implications are nothing short of what Jeremy Rifkin calls the [Third Industrial Revolution.](http://www.thethirdindustrialrevolution.com)

[Speakers from a wide array of fields, from urban design to gaming to robotics,](http://createtech.aaaa.org/createtech-speakers/) will explore how individuals, technologists and brands will be advancing new models of communication design for pervasive media and new personal and social behaviors and habits.



---

#CreateTech’s theme: No edges: humans machines environments

**Applications: knowledge, skills, working together**
The edges between disciplines in engineering, creative expression and media are breaking down. Data, automation, ubiquitous sensing and expressive devices are blurring the edges between all forms of interactive communications and media channels. 

And once hard edges of silo’ed expertise are blurring into collaborative practices, team structures and value exchange.  Dedicated sessions will grapple with the requirements and challenges of the new creative team; how to attract and hold top talent; how to plan for and reap excellence.

#CreateTech’s theme: No edges: humans machines environments

**Our stories: client, agencies, consumers, ourselves**
CreateTech tells great stories--from agencies, marketers, technologists and everyone--about the ways that digitally enabled physical and virtual environments are changing how we live, what we do and how we think and feel.
