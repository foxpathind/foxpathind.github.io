#Some remarks on B2B (Financial Services)

Eventually I think it will break down to specific categories of funds like real estate, commodities, energy, private equity, etc. There's a continual cry for education around alts. Emerging markets is also a happening category right now and that also lends itself to content marketing. I understand that lots of active money is shifting to ETFs but I don't have any real experience with what's happening there. But that also is generally about more finely targeted niches so showing off your knowledge works for them as well.

Here's a good sample of a microsite from Alger focused on a topic. I suspect they are going to roll out one topic at a time and have a 1-3 year plan for this for building on this base. The video shows the sophistication level that has emerged just in the past 3-5 years. 
http://www.thinkfurtheralger.com/auto/?utm_source=ii&utm_medium=banner&utm_content=logo&utm_campaign=med

> That movement toward more sophisticated rolling campaigns focused on content marketing

(away from the one-shot campaign like we always did at Wechsler) seems to be taking root. 

I think BlackRock was the first to successfully do it with this campaign which I think they touted as having a 5-year plan:
http://www.pinterest.com/pin/42150946483651719/

That's my pinterest page, btw, where I try to collect campaign sites when I have the time. I try to go through each issue of Institutional Investor and collect the campaigns.

Oppenheimer got a shitload of -- I think undeserved -- credit for their "Globalize Your Thinking" campaign. They made a separate site to build on over the course of year. I think the marketing manager for Oppenheimer was just really good at self-promotion. It was a pretty nice site and organized well but I suspect there was nothing there to really keep people coming back. I bet their overall return rates were not good.

Here at Addison, they did a really nice job with a permanent content marketing site/campaign for Fitch called the Why Forum. They set it up for Fitch, did some events, an intro video and a set of style guides to let Fitch add content themselves. 

There are a couple of levels of video production speced out ranging from multi-camera to smart phone via Skype. It's a nice effort that really allows for a perpetual campaign.

I also think the marketers are getting better at analytics and a/b testing and the like. But I'm not sure. We still get brought in for the onset of a campaign only. And don't get me wrong, there's still a lot of crap going on. Just look at my Pinterest page.

But there's a lot of sophistication happening in the web presentation too. Here's a page that Kristen designed and Tradeweb is about to roll out. Marketers right now really love all the bells and whistles (sometimes whether it communicates or not).
