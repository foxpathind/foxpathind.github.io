#Technology in the agency

##Technology in business
- Foreign affairs
##4 areas of concentration at 4As

- Technology expertise and management has become increasingly become larger part of agency operations and even creative capabilities. 
- Their responsibilities now overlap with many of the agency roles today. 
- From strategy to delivery, most agency activities now have a technology component or have become technology driven.

##Technologist communities, at various stages of maturity, in agencies today include:

- Creative technology (digital strategies, programming and development, experience design, special effects, physical computing, R&D, Content development/management) – [constituency overlap – Creative, Content]
- Marketing technology (CRM, integration, data science and analytics)
- Media and Ad Operations (ad formats and file optimization, automation, integrated strategies and planning) – [constituency overlap - Media]
- Agency management/operations technology (IT- systems of record and project management systems, client service, asset and content management)



##Issues in forefront for 2014:
- Defining and structuring new agency practices such as experience and usability, programming and quality assurance, content development, physical computing 
- Talent recruitment and retention in creative technology positions
- Increased enterprise technology and project management requirements (service level agreements, security and project management certifications)
- New digital strategy and creative development practices and participants
- Practicing innovation in the agency

##Technology and agency roles, skills and positions
###Professionalization of agency roles
*Moving to the consulting model?
*Production still providing the profits
###Assesment
###CMO CIO connection
*CT talk
*SapientNitro program


#Some remarks - Financial Services

As advisors increasingly shun the Morningstar style box ("It only really applies to US equities"), the old ideas about asset allocation have been discarded and nothing concrete has taken its place. The manufacturers are getting more savvy about content marketing and the use of videos to make claims for niches. The overall rally is around "alternatives" and "liquid alts" but I personally see that as a transition category. 

Eventually I think it will break down to specific categories of funds like real estate, commodities, energy, private equity, etc. There's a continual cry for education around alts. Emerging markets is also a happening category right now and that also lends itself to content marketing. I understand that lots of active money is shifting to ETFs but I don't have any real experience with what's happening there. But that also is generally about more finely targeted niches so showing off your knowledge works for them as well.

Here's a good sample of a microsite from Alger focused on a topic. I suspect they are going to roll out one topic at a time and have a 1-3 year plan for this for building on this base. The video shows the sophistication level that has emerged just in the past 3-5 years.

> That movement toward more sophisticated rolling campaigns focused on content marketing

(away from the one-shot campaign like we always did at Wechsler) seems to be taking root. 

I think BlackRock was the first to successfully do it with this campaign which I think they touted as having a 5-year plan:

That's my pinterest page, btw, where I try to collect campaign sites when I have the time. I try to go through each issue of Institutional Investor and collect the campaigns.

Oppenheimer got a shitload of -- I think undeserved -- credit for their "Globalize Your Thinking" campaign. They made a separate site to build on over the course of year. I think the marketing manager for Oppenheimer was just really good at self-promotion. It was a pretty nice site and organized well but I suspect there was nothing there to really keep people coming back. I bet their overall return rates were not good.

Here at Addison, they did a really nice job with a permanent content marketing site/campaign for Fitch called the Why Forum. They set it up for Fitch, did some events, an intro video and a set of style guides to let Fitch add content themselves. 

There are a couple of levels of video production speced out ranging from multi-camera to smart phone via Skype. It's a nice effort that really allows for a perpetual campaign.

I also think the marketers are getting better at analytics and a/b testing and the like. But I'm not sure. We still get brought in for the onset of a campaign only. And don't get me wrong, there's still a lot of crap going on. Just look at my Pinterest page.

But there's a lot of sophistication happening in the web presentation too. Here's a page that Kristen designed and Tradeweb is about to roll out. Marketers right now really love all the bells and whistles (sometimes whether it communicates or not).

##CreateTech
###4A’s CreateTech 2014: No edges: humans machines environments
####Nov 12-13
####Microsoft NERD Center - Cambridge, MA

####Creativity and the internet of everything: New data, new abilities, new behaviors, new designs.
####We’re exploring with the leaders working on the frontiers of our expanding digital lives.

####Conference Snapshot
* Meeting place for agency technologists, creatives and strategists.
* Summit for presenting and discussing the great work and collaborations in creative experiences and communication design.
* An opportunity to explore our the digital future with thought leaders, visionaries, leading-edge marketers and peers.

Organized by the advertising industry’s association, the [4A's](http://www.aaaa.org), CreateTech’s annual gathering is a singular opportunity to focus on the dynamic interaction of technology and the industry’s creative disciplines.
For the past three years, CreateTech has been a leading event exploring the outer limits of digital creative and the changes technology has brought to the industry.

####CreateTech’s theme for 2014 is: No edges: humans machines environments

####CreateTech tackles investigates this theme in three ways:

#####“Ambient intelligence”: people, places, things
The starting point is the emerging internet of everything, an ever-more-connected world of people, places and things: Wearable technology; smart appliances; connected cars; homes and environments. The implications are nothing short of what Jeremy Rifkin calls the [Third Industrial Revolution.](http://www.thethirdindustrialrevolution.com)

[Speakers from a wide array of fields, from urban design to gaming to robotics,](http://createtech.aaaa.org/createtech-speakers/) will explore how individuals, technologists and brands will be advancing new models of communication design for pervasive media and new personal and social behaviors and habits.

#####Applications: knowledge, skills, working together
The edges between disciplines in engineering, creative expression and media are breaking down. Data, automation, ubiquitous sensing and expressive devices are blurring the edges between all forms of interactive communications and media channels. 

And once hard edges of silo’ed expertise are blurring into collaborative practices, team structures and value exchange.  Dedicated sessions will grapple with the requirements and challenges of the new creative team; how to attract and hold top talent; how to plan for and reap excellence.

#####Our stories: client, agencies, consumers, ourselves
CreateTech tells great stories--from agencies, marketers, technologists and everyone--about the ways that digitally enabled physical and virtual environments are changing how we live, what we do and how we think and feel.

And, of course, CreateTech celebrates and highlights the work—inspiring, dazzling, far-reaching—born of these collaborations.

We are very pleased to be holding CreateTech in Boston the home of MIT MediaLab, the Harvard iLab,  [a vibrant startup community and a city that is pioneering in it’s deployment of the internet of things.](FastCompany article - http://www.fastcompany.com/3033636/internet-of-things/in-boston-the-internet-of-things-is-already-in-front-of-your-face)
