# New Web Site

## Taxonomy Project
- Workshops are gradually bringing us to where we are almost ready to approach individual departments. 
- We've prepared a Google form that will be used to gather preliminary taxonomy-related data. 
- Department reps will be asked to use that form to classify a few pieces of their teams' content. 
- Results will be aggregated for further analysis.

## VML/Website Strategy
- Meetings with VML are also continuing
	- Marci scheduling
- Their team is presently meeting various 4A's stakeholders
- We're planning additional discussions, including analytics, this coming week.

What we should be doing

- Additional internal analysis, documenting the strategic wish lists
- Additional WordPress research (state of plug-ins for taxonomy, authentication, etc. 
	- (several mature examples exist)
- Proof of concept site, to help us understand the options ahead of reaching this point with VML.
- Understanding of the latest additions in forthcoming WordPress 4.0.

## Overall
		

- Incremental progress is required to sustain the existing site prior to the availability of the new one. At the moment, I am concerned we don't have the resources even to maintain the status quo, let alone plan and carry out any incremental improvements. An increasingly heavy meeting schedule has reduced the amount of time I have available for ordinary support and production tasks. Jules has been focused on media partnerships. 

- It should be noted that even before the current mix of projects, the general tasks required for ordinary day-to-day maintenance (including the assistance of members with login issues, questions, etc.) already limited the pace of our progress in advancing the site. We typically needed 80% of available time just to tread water.

- There remain some smaller (but still noticeable) issues and style glitches within the current site. Several have been surfaced through research (intermittent authentication issues with one of the databases for users accessing the site from Macs with Google Chrome), several through various other means. Style glitches make some of the event registration areas hard to use in IE, with fields and field labels overlapping. As soon as traffic picks up in September, we may see an increase in members reporting these issues, and I am concerned about having time to follow up within reasonable time frames.

- Plan to revamp the main landing pages is currently paused, due to limited time. Revising those landing pages is a labor intensive process, requiring considerable collaboration with the team responsible for the content. 

- Overall production process is becoming inefficient, and problematic. It should ideally funnel through a single workflow, but now we have three departments involved instead of two. 

- We should be conducting audits of the existing site content, particularly the downloads, and updating older materials as needed, so that the bulk of the content has already been scrubbed prior to discussions of migration into the new site.

- Patrick Conlin was working on getting us an export listing all files in the Sharepoint documents library, but encountered some issues and has not had time to work past them, in light of other projects. (I too have had no additional time to help him out). 

## Membership section improvements
- No one has had time to continue these in the last few weeks. We were also tentatively planning an infographic, member roster, and several other additions. 
- I followed up with Mollie recently, and the form we deployed has been helpful. 
- Additional improvements to this section seem appropriate, especially given recently loss of members. 

## Conference web sites & Sharepoint
- Issues finding existing resources continue to surface in multiple meetings and discussions.
- We need to adopt a practice of creating at least one page in Sharepoint announcing and summarizing any program/event that receives an off-domain website. This is the best way to ensure that anyone who searches for such sites on aaaa.org via either search engine or general navigation will find what they are looking for.
- Conference archives still need work, for related reasons. 
- In some cases, this is complicated by lack of a clear business owner (i.e., ReSolve). 

## Search engine project
- We were investigating the possibility of replacing the current Sharepoint search with a third-party tool capable of crawling more than just aaaa.org (i.e., including the ancillary and event sites).
- Unclear whether we should proceed with this, or simply wait for the new web site. This seems a long period of time to proceed with a very flawed search engine, but it seems unlikely that any of us will have time to pursue an interim solution.
- Laura has brought up SEO in a general sense at least twice at recent meetings. This is indeed something that we should have in our workplan, but it's not something for which we have the bandwidth at this time.

## Website login account pages 
- Marci prepared some text revisions to improve the account registration pages. I was originally hoping to deploy them gradually during the month of August, but additional time will be needed.

## Google Analytics
- We haven't had time to do any significant analysis of current usage trends since the spring.
- Additionally, I have seen a few data artifacts that suggest some issues with the accuracy of certain site profiles in our account. A more comprehensive review is needed to investigate. At present, I cannot predict when I will have sufficient time to address this. 

##Additional tabled topics/projects
- Data Advisory Council page
- Strategic Initiatives page
- RSS feed to surface the Patent Forum under Management Services
- Advocacy area enhancements

# Ancillary Sites/Consolidation of Hosting

- A VPS environment has been set up at InMotion, thanks to Patrick Conlin. We will be consolidating (non-Squarespace) ancillary sites into this environment as time permits.

- I've created a WordPress environment there for the Atlanta Council Website, and handed it off to the folks who will be building that site. 

- 4A's Benefits will be the next site hosted there. I encountered some issues migrating their new/dev site and am still working through them. Once finished, I'll turn over to the 4A's Benefits team to finish the content updates necessary before launch.

- IAM High School site will need a duplicate environment there too. I have not yet had time to replicate their existing site for them.

- This environment will still need some fine tuning before we begin systematically migrating/consolidating the rest of our sites there.
