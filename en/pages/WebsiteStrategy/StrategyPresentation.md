## Common themes
- Shared concerns
	- Members and management
- Site design 
	- Not representing
	- Not a community but an archive
	- Not a refelction of agency websites
- Content
	- Content not updated feeds the perception

## Packaging the 4A's is a hard business
- Go beyond awareness

	- More value BEFORE the login
## Membership loss
- M&A
- Perceived lack of value

## Talk to people not agencies
### **My 4A's**
- more personal value!
- individual 
- subscribed to content

##Pain points
- engage AFTER joining
- continue to convey the the value
- insight to roles
	- what have people ALREADY done, engaged
- how to track an agencies activity
- how to track the one-to-one relationship
	- now done "retail"

## How does the add up

- Help embers and non members
- Personal development 
- Get the number of people USING 4A's members services
