## Checking With Wordpress Vendors ##

- Taxonomy pilot project
- Content management
	- Repository
- Alley Interactive
	- Great idea
	- Low 5 figures - under $50K ?
	- Would go into the development project
	- Project looks 
		- Skeleton migration step - of website 
		- Or do all content
		- save a reference to original location
		- create a taxonomy tool
		- to develop as a "plug-in"
		- then tag the the migrated content
		- We could start looking at what this will look like
		- Create pilot pages
			- (Need to list all the skills and management necessary)
			- (What does the project look like now)
	- Document management
		- File system? possible?
		- Sharepoint? we would need to upgrade in order to make the investment worthwhile
		- What is the status now
			- Files?
			- Sharepoint?
			- netForum?
- What is the state of the taxonomy?
	- Need an update? on
		- Subjects
		- Audiences
		- Regions
		- Content types
- Get VML involved - get on the calendar
- Create a list of questions
