### Introduction (I think we need something like this)
#### 4A's Website Redesign ##

The 4A's has initiated a wide-ranging project to redesign it's main web properties for the organization, the trade association for the advertising industry. The redesign effort will touch many facets of the site but particularly the organization of the content, the utility and activities offered, the overall usability and attractiveness of the design. 

Getting a good sense of the users' and 4A's member's view of the current and an ideal website is very valuable information to help guide us in our efforts. If your agency does digital design work you may be very familiar with this activity and it's goals in the design process. 

The 4A's has engaged VML a member agency to provide their professional services to develop the design strategy among other aspects of the project.

The 4As web team and VML are very happy that you would consider helping us with your reactions and insights as we work up the user-centered framework we will use to drive the redesign


######As first step in the program we’re looking for input from people at 4A's member agencies about the 4A’s
1. what is your general know ledge of the 4A's and it's offerings
2. Overall experiences access/ using 4A's information and resources
3. Your experience with the main or any other 4A's website you're aware of and the functionality provided 
4. Along with the web, what kind of digital tools do you use today and would like in the future. 
 
Optimally, we'd like two to three people: an exec, a mid-senior leader on the path to senior leadership and/or a more junior version of that, from different departments so there's broad representation. (***CF: What's the total ask? 3, 6, 9 people, the minimum?***)

Ideal individuals are agency employees who have been involved with the 4A's in some way (e.g. have an account, have participated in event/conference, help maintain the relationship with the 4A's). (***CF: Is this true? Wouldn't we want a any representative of a desirable audience to get their feelings and general use of the web for information and social activity?***)

We’d like to spend and hour with each of you, individually, to talk about your experience with the 4A's.

This is a casual, open-format conversation, so we have no prepared questions or agendas. 

We do however, wish to record these conversations (audio only!). 

***These recordings will not be shared with the 4A’s, but are for VML’s own transcription needs only. (CF: Is the purpose to make people feel more open to criticize? Not sure I understand the necessity. )***

####For team discussion (not part of the letter to agency)
#####List of Topics
That being said, below are a list of topics I plan to cover - let me know if you have any additions or feedback!

- Their role, how it's changing, what new needs they have (*personal role?*, )
- Extra-circulars: what other industry organizations/clubs they participate in (*and then ask about or infer their web experiences?*)
-  Knowledge of what the 4A's offers - from an awareness perspective
-  Use of current 4A's resources and whether they access them through the website or otherwise
-  Appetite for new offerings (*Since the web project will not involve the development of new 4A's services such as new training programs, though new programs may be developed, please explain*)
	-  Past training experiences (4A's and otherwise)
-  Past experiences interacting with the 4A's (via website, webinar, or in person)
-  Industry thought leadership: what they read/watch and why
