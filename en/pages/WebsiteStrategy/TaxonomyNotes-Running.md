_email notes_

Yes i think we’re headed for multiple taxonomies, most rather small for the “facets” that will be used for searching for things:

Further “sketching”...

- Audience
	- Role
		- Constituencies
		- Normalized Job Descriptions
		
	- Role Category 
		- (Examples)
		- Minder - Managing your agency
		- Finder - Managing clients
		- Grinder - Managing the work
		- (might add)
		- Managing your career
- Activities
- Regions
- Topics
- Issues
- Content Type
- Content Format


All of this can be handled in WordPress
The document management part though not


More later!

- Meeting with Austin
- Set up the meeting
- Designing the taxonomy for faceted search
	- comprehensiveness
	- usefully shallow
- Kaiser Data taxonomy migration
	- taxonomy restructure
	- Kaisier from 12 website to one
	- user oriented
- Writers have to tag their work
- Controlled vocabulary
- Look at multiple axes
	- topics
		- 
	- tags
	- content type
		- opt in content type to create type
		- for system organization fields and template
		- web and pdf - format
		- issue briefs, reports, poll report, fact sheet, policy tracker




###
-  What is the current state of WordPress taxonomy tools -- maturity and sophistication of existing plug-ins, etc.? 

- Did Alley start with one of those plug-ins, or build their own solution from scratch? What considerations led to their approach? Are there any obvious implications to our next steps at the 4A's?

- What were some of the more significant performance considerations?

- Chick and I have each built several smaller WordPress sites, and are familiar with the nuts and bolts. I'd like to get a better sense of what the overall experience is like, and how it may differ, in a site the size of KFF's -- specifically for both content editors and site administrators. Essentially, what does it look like under the hood? How can the admin dashboard be modified to facilitate editorial access when a site contains thousands of pages? 

- How is KFF handling document management? Is it done within WordPress, or rather via an interface with some other asset management system?

### Discussion
- User testing
     - Card sorting
- Types
     - Navigation
     - Faceted search
     - Search
     - MESE
          - Mutualally exclusive
          - Exhaustive
     - Navigation vs Organization
- The 4As perspective not necessarily the outside perspective
     - Not prompted to use a outside perspective
- Taxonomy doesn’t have to be navigation
     - Needs rules
     - No soft rules
     - Relevance
     - Strongly related
- Strategy
     - Audience types
          - Levels
     - Tagging for those audiences
     - Access
          - permissions
          - role
- Conceptual grouping
     - Gap analysis
     - Content life spans
          - creation data
          - check for relevance

- Strategy meeting
     - Strategy
     - Content strategy


##CF Notes
- Taggers needs
- Conceptual groupings
     - Themes
     - Subjects
     

## Walkthrough
- What would be human-applied by the tagger
- Audiences
- Regional
     - International
          - non-US
          - (probably need world regions)
     - Councils
- Agency Lifecycle
- Content types
     - mobile ready?

## Checking With Wordpress Vendors ##

- Taxonomy pilot project
- Content management
	- Repository
- Alley Interactive
	- Great idea
	- Low 5 figures - under $50K ?
	- Would go into the development project
	- Project looks 
		- Skeleton migration step - of website 
		- Or do all content
		- save a reference to original location
		- create a taxonomy tool
		- to develop as a "plug-in"
		- then tag the the migrated content
		- We could start looking at what this will look like
		- Create pilot pages
			- (Need to list all the skills and management necessary)
			- (What does the project look like now)
	- Document management
		- File system? possible?
		- Sharepoint? we would need to upgrade in order to make the investment worthwhile
		- What is the status now
			- Files?
			- Sharepoint?
			- netForum?
- What is the state of the taxonomy?
	- Need an update? on
		- Subjects
		- Audiences
		- Regions
		- Content types
- Get VML involved - get on the calendar
- Create a list of questions

### Next Steps ###

- Taxonomy review

- 

HBR - 
their redesign is going through is reducing 1200 terms to 200



### Activities


- exercise
- existing
- analysis
- interim
- strategy
	- will the impact the interim state of a taxonomy

#### Tools ####

- manage terms 
- useful for the implementation
