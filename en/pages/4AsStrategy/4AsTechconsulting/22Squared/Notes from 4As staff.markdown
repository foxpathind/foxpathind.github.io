Attachment 1 - "DiSC Assessment". I recently had a lengthy conversation on the topic of Agency Operation with the Associate Director of Account Service at Spawn in Anchorage. Resource and Workflow Management came up and led to agreement that developing better practices in agency operations should include an early "introspective" assessment by senior agency management of key factors that effect resources and workflow, for example, skill levels of existing staff, client needs, and agency service offerings ... to name just three.  

This assessment (a "reality check") should be the basis of determining how an agency should best plan for these areas. 

I was surprised to hear that this relatively small agency had gone a long way with it. They went through a staff personality assessment exercise using the "DiSC" approach.  In another example, I met several weeks with the Managing Partner, PMO at Rosetta, a 1,000 person agency and found that his senior management team made similar assessments of its staff. In this case, the agency used a tool created by that individual.

Attachments 2 & 3 - my notes to two events, one held at BSSP in Sausalito on March 4th and the second at McCann Worldgroup in NYC on April 23rd. 
The theme of the two meetings was "Structuring Agency Functions: The Intersection of Account, Project, and Production Managements". (Please excuse the format.)
