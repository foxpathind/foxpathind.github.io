## Registration Process ##

- Dev server goes up

## OTI Improvements ##

- log in or create a new account
	- create account
	- matches domain 
	- associate an org
	- OR no associations
	- the change is how we verify your email
		- now we send a code, click on link, the verify
		- people don't read the email
		- **1. send email with link back to event page no verification of the email address with codes**
- problem: can't register people outside your immediate office
	- doesn't work for sister offices
	- can't modify drop down of suggested users
	- **2. type ahead search box of all org related names**
- if it's a new person?
	- **3. adding a new account should be more like the staff roster**
	- add roles, delete roles
	- only certain people can do this
	- we want the data the data to conform
	- make it simpler, with fewer fields
	- _reliability check for different conditions_
		- does domain exist?
		- does the org exist?
		- users won't show up to be registered if the account is not associated with the org tree
		- business rules demands a role for attachment to an org
