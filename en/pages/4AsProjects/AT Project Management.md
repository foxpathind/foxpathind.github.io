Following on the heels of the above, where possible provide examples.  Case in point when I mentioned to him part of our approach around PM would be to acknowledge that they have done a lot of work to find the right PM software/tools but that theory and practice can be two very different things and they can hit some real bumps in the road as they start to implement the plan - he noted that we should call out what some of those bumps in the road are and how we can help them avoid them or at least ease the pain.  Jeff who'll be in the meeting has been leading the charge on Project Management so good to spend some time on this.
