Following on the heels of the above, where possible provide examples.  Case in point when I mentioned to him part of our approach around PM would be to acknowledge that they have done a lot of work to find the right PM software/tools but that theory and practice can be two very different things and they can hit some real bumps in the road as they start to implement the plan - he noted that we should call out what some of those bumps in the road are and how we can help them avoid them or at least ease the pain.  Jeff who'll be in the meeting has been leading the charge on Project Management so good to spend some time on this.

All,

I had the opportunity to talk with Jose Andrade (Chick's contact in IT at Abelson Taylor) as well as Mark Schneider who has worked closely with AT for the past 13 years.

A few additional insights for us as we pull together our slides and plan of attack.

Overall, Mark offered the following in terms of our approach:
1. Be specific.  Jay and Jeff in particular are incredibly smart, and want to cut through the "glowing generalities" and fluff to the hard facts.
2. Following on the heels of the above, where possible provide examples.  Case in point when I mentioned to him part of our approach around PM would be to acknowledge that they have done a lot of work to find the right PM software/tools but that theory and practice can be two very different things and they can hit some real bumps in the road as they start to implement the plan - he noted that we should call out what some of those bumps in the road are and how we can help them avoid them or at least ease the pain.  Jeff who'll be in the meeting has been leading the charge on Project Management so good to spend some time on this.
3. Feel free to ask questions.  They will not respond well, as we knew, to us going in and telling them their business.  Providing a solution without understanding them and their situation will not fly.  Obviously we want to go in with some understanding of them but they will also appreciate that we want to better understand their needs before offering up a solution.

A few specifics from my convo with Mark:
1. New Biz
A key place where he feels they need help is getting an entree to new biz consultants.  Not just a list of names but an introduction.  Not sure what we can do here but our work with Adforum seemed like it maybe fit the bill?  Whatever we can do to be a liason to the search consultant community would be good.  

He also mentioned that their issue is even if they tell their story to a consultant, HC is probably a small portion of what that consultant does so how do they stay top of mind when their area of expertise has a small share of mind.

They also have won a TON of awards (in their  HC arena), particularly creative.  He felt mentioning the partner awards could be good as a way to get recognition amongst the broader industry (as we had already talked).

2. Benchmarking
While they don't see other agencies as being worthy peers to learn from in most instances, there are certain industry standards that they would benefit from such as our Salary Surveys, Labor and Billing rates, Utilization rates etc.  Also he mentioned legal help. Tom, you know best what we have in this realm.

3. He mentioned the agency GSW in Columbus as being one they see as perhaps a peer (similar size,HC,  independent -or were anyway)  They are not members, at least now.  Laurie, do you have any info on them?  Not essential if they aren't members but good to be aware of them.

4. Learning & Development.  It was interesting that he had no clue that they had hired a L&D person.  It has not been an area of focus for them.  His advice was to probe in the meeting what gap did they see that led to the hire? what skill set are they trying to develop. When I asked Jose if he had any more info what the goals of the role were, he said she will centralize, optimize and vet all training offerings under the AT umbrella. That there was a need  from a higher view to wrangle in disparate initiatives. When I asked if there was a skill set she was trying to develop there, he said part was digital (which I specifically asked about) but  said it will be all inclusive t including considerations around operations, new business, tools etc.  

He also said that they are in the shaping stage of their training program - I think anything we have on guidance or set curriculums that help them not recreate the wheel could be good.

SINGLETON - would probably be good to have Bob create a list of bucket areas we have training in and then provide some specifics on what we offer within those buckets to have on hand for the conversation. FYI, Her name is Peggy Degnan.

The link below goes to an article on them from this summer.  They do talk about their focus on Digital (which is something Jose mentioned as well) and it doesn't sound like they are newbies to this area (they have a digital steering team).

Specific from my convo with Jose

1. Events/PR/Publishing opportunities.

They hired a new communications director 8 months ago.  They are focusing on getting thought leadership whitepapers out there as well as speaking opportunities.  They do sponsorship and events but the need is to get in front of a broader audience.


2. Talent/training - I talked above

3. our events - he mentioned the value of our events ( specifically createtech which is what he's most familiar with) from the standpoint that we're bringing together influential people that they should be associating with, and that the events are guiding the industry.

4. Research - Marsha I know we're not focusing here but for the "back pocket" info you're pulling for me, I wanted to let you know that they do have access to the following data bases, forrester capgemny, manahattan research, gartner, possibly others as well but these are the ones he mentioned.

 
NEXT STEPS:

I know folks were trying to pull slides together and get them to me by EOD Friday.  Great if we can keep to that schedule but let me know.

I'm on Jury duty next week but I'm hoping I'll be released, worst case scenario after Wednesday but hopefully sooner.  I'd love to do a run through with the deck on Wednesday so that we have Thursday to tweak as needed. I'll put time on people's calendars to meet.
