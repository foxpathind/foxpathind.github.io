Organized by the advertising industry’s association, the 4A's, CreateTech’s annual gathering is a singular opportunity to focus on the dynamic interaction of technology and the industry’s creative disciplines.
For the past three years, CreateTech has been a leading event exploring the outer limits of digital creative and the changes technology has brought to the industry.

###CreateTech’s theme for 2014 is: No edges: humans machines environments

####CreateTech tackles investigates this theme in three ways:

#####“Ambient intelligence”: people, places, things
The starting point is the emerging internet of everything, an ever-more-connected world of people, places and things: Wearable technology; smart appliances; connected cars; homes and environments. 

Speakers will explore how individuals, technologists and brands will be dealing with new products, communication design for pervasive media and new personal and social behaviors and habits.

#####Applications: knowledge, skills, working together
The edges between disciplines in engineering, creative expression and media are breaking down. Data, automation, ubiquitous sensing and expressive devices are blurring the edges between all forms of interactive communications and media channels. 

And once hard edges of silo’ed expertise are blurring into collaborative practices, team structures and value exchange.  Dedicated sessions will grapple with the requirements and challenges of the new creative team; how to attract and hold top talent; how to plan for and reap excellence.

#####Our stories: client, agencies, consumers, ourselves
CreateTech tells great stories--from agencies, marketers, technologists and everyone--about the ways that digitally enabled physical and virtual environments are changing how we live, what we do and how we think and feel.

And, of course, CreateTech celebrates and highlights the work—inspiring, dazzling, far-reaching—born of these collaborations.

We are very pleased to be holding CreateTech in Boston the home of MIT MediaLab, the Harvard iLab,  a vibrant startup community and a city that is pioneering in it’s deployment of the internet of things.
