Innocean and Neuroscience: 
Could the key to unlocking genuine connections between consumers and brands lie in understanding a single neurochemical called oxytocin? Creative agency INNOCEAN is using the latest science to identify why trust, empathy and connection are rooted deep in our mammalian brains and what this means for the future of brands. INNOCEAN USA's VP of Digital & Engagement Strategy, Uwe Gutschow, will explore the relationship between oxytocin and consumerâ€™s ability to trust and connect with brands. Uwe will explain why companies that are able to raise our oxytocin levels will prosper by diving deep into the world of neuroscience, economics, biology and psychology. The discussion will also examine the moral implications of tailoring communications to maximize oxytocin release and the possibility of using it as a metric for success in the future. In addition, Uwe will discuss how INNOCEAN has used this science to tailor campaigns for clients including Hyundai.
