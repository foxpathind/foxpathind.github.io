## Mike Digiovani - CreateTech 2014 Wearables workshop

#### Normal Running Time: 1:30-2:00
#### Ideal number of participants
- Max of 15, to be broken up into teams of 3-4. 
- The couch based area you mentioned might be good for the style of talk I'm thinking. 
- There would be no problem with trimming this down to 10 for space concerns, maybe we could do it twice if thereâ€™s enough interest.
 
#### Summary of workshop, description of activities, outcomes or results

The workshop will begin with a talk about the current state of modern wearable hardware and software. This will include both general purpose wearables, like smartwatches, and more focused wearables like fitness bands and custom hardware. We will discuss what works and what has failed across consumer oriented wearables in the past 4 years. The goal is to give attendees an understanding of how to approach designing an experience that ties into modern consumer wearables.

The initial discussion will be followed by a design exercise where small teams will come up with a simple wearable product that embraces some of the principles previously discussed.  This can be new hardware or just software designed to run on an existing wearable platform. We will have a variety of wearables to get some hands-on time with as well as 3D printed mock ups of unavailable devices like the Apple Watch. Attendees will be provided with a suggested hardware and software platform to jumpstart their creativity if they aren't feeling particularly creative that day.

The main goal of this activity is to show off how hardware will often dictate how your software works and what interactions a user will want to have and allow the atttendees to apply some of the knowledge already gained
                The workshop will conclude with a discussion on the results of the design exercises as we talk through each product.
