### Proposed Panel Abstract
When a major athletic shoe brand starts thinking of an advertising campaign for their new line of cleats – one of the most important things on their list is ensuring its brand identity (the logo and famous typeface) are displayed properly in every ad. Sounds simple, right? 

Well, until recently that was one of the most challenging parts of the workflow for creating a digital advertising campaign – especially one that cascaded across an ecosystem that now includes desktop, laptops, smartphones, tablets, watches and wearables. For years, digital ads were created and then attempted to scale to various mediums, often compromising text quality and disrupting brand consistency. It was costly, ineffective and created a lag in the ability to respond to real-time advertising opportunities.
 
Naysayers may think “mobile ads are a ‘nice to have’ but no one is really using them, right?” Well, according to eMarketer, mobile ad spending will jump 83 percent this year to become an $18 billion market.  Things are getting real.
 
How can brands and creative teams collaborate? By getting on board with HTML5.
 
HTML5 is destined to completely reinvent the way digital ads are created, shared and optimized. No longer will a designer have to worry about making 14 versions of the same ad to accommodate various screen sizes. Gone are the days where a brand manager winces when he sees his morphed logo on a tablet screen. HTML 5 changes that by creating a more consistent, scalable way to improve ad performance and the user experience across all platforms – while significantly reducing operational costs.
