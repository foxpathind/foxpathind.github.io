##Jason Levy
####SVP Engagement Strategy & Innovation 
####Saatchi & Saatchi Wellness 

With 10+ years of experience helping healthcare companies traverse the digital waters of communication, Jason has become a marketing innovation specialist. His diverse digital background in strategy, UX, creative, production, and operations has enabled him to serve as the strategic mind behind numerous ground-breaking initiatives for such clients as J&J, Merck, Novartis, and Pfizer to name just a few. 

Jason has made a career out of applying new and emerging technologies and media channels to marketing communications. Exploring the digital health landscape Jason began to come across more and more examples of the merger of man and machine, sparking a deep and somewhat peculiar interest in biohacking, transhumanism and the notion of the posthuman. When he's not busy addressing human healthcare behavior with todayâ€™s technology, Jason's investigating next-gen technology and medicine, the future's truly connected human and the possibilities within.
