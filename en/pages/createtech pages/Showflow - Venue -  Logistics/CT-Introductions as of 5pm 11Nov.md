WORKSHOP, Wearables Design Workshop With Mike DiGiovanni, Mobile Architect, Isobar
>
The workshop will begin with a talk about the current state of modern wearable hardware and software. This will include both general purpose wearables, like smartwatches, and more focused wearables like fitness bands and custom hardware.

We will discuss what works and what has failed across consumer-oriented wearables in the past 4 years. The goal is to give attendees an understanding of how to approach designing an experience that ties into modern consumer wearables.
>
The initial discussion will be followed by a design exercise where small teams will come up with a simple wearable product that embraces some of the principles previously discussed. This can be new hardware or just software designed to run on an existing wearable platform.
>
We will have a variety of wearables to get some hands-on time with as well as 3D printed mock-ups of unavailable devices like the Apple Watch. Attendees will be provided with a suggested hardware and software platform to jumpstart their creativity.
>
The main goal of this activity is to show off how hardware will often dictate how your software works and what interactions a user will want to have and allow the atttendees to apply some of the knowledge already gained.
>
The workshop will conclude with a discussion on the results of the design exercises as we talk through each product.

To create a new automotive shopping tool that was truly inventive and globally relevant, we not only needed the best creatives, technologists and producers in the business, we also had to create an international team of marketers, project managers, international IT leadership and money people to carry it across the finish line.
While these groups often have competing priorities and skill sets, this team was charged with collaborating across nine time zones, several languages, seven companies, global scrutiny and a complete change in leadership. We’ll discuss how the right internal champions and external partners were selected, motivated and engaged to let us clear all the hurdles that plague these large-scale efforts on the way to an on-time launch of an award-winning product.

Beyond Wearables - Jason Alan Snyder, Momentum WorldWide, Moderator, Marcel Botha, CEO, 10xBETA, Jessica Banks, CEO and Founder, RockPaperRobot, Stacey Mulcahy, Technical Evangelist, Microsoft, S. Jason Prohaska, CEO, Your Majesty
What happens when the “wearable” we buy moves inside of us? From our wrists and necks to the inside of our bodies? Today we are the intersection of “bits” and “atoms.” As those lines blurs we see an advancing merger between our biology and our technology. These ideas have lived on the fringe for a while but with the adoption of biometrics in our smart devices (finger prints, heart rate, etc.) this convergence is now mainstream . So what’s next? And what are the implications for advertisers and brands in this new space? This panel will explore these ideas as they come to manifest in the near term and a bit further out.

The Evolution of the Creative Technologist - Sheldon Monteiro, Chief Technology Officer, SapientNitro
The role of the creative technologist has come a long way. At the intersection of software development and creative interpretation, creative technologists have been the architects and brick-layers for amazing interactive work. Yet, the stakes for digital continue to evolve – interactive systems are now the face of sales, customer support and service.
People make no distinction between attraction, engagement, transaction and retention – brands must provide a seamless experience across those interaction states. Against this backdrop, the systems to serve all those interactions must be beautiful, compelling, useful and usable. And they must be trustworthy, scalable and available.
Creative technologists are needed more than ever. But our skills must evolve. Join us for this compelling talk will that will focus on the case for change and the landscape of skills that must be acquired in the coming era.

Last year’s description:
Innovation Labs are popping up in agencies all over the country. Think tanks, maker spaces, incubators—the models vary widely. Labs have been launched at agencies large and small, integrated and digital, independent and networked. But do agency labs truly produce valuable innovation? Or are they merely showcases for shiny objects? Should your agency start a lab? How much should be invested, and how will you demonstrate monetary return? Should it focus on thought leadership, experiments, prototypes, products or even launching startups? These questions and many more will be answered by the early movers in this space.

Key secrets to creating a successful arts-influenced, brand-sponsored experiential design project
Top 5 most compelling questions that need to be addressed before embarking on either one of these endeavors
Main differences and similarities between working for an artist and working for a brand manager or an ad agency

Visualization Culture: Data Literacy for the Rest of Us - Fernanda Viegas, Research Scientist, Google
Data visualization has historically been accessible only to the elite in academia, business, and government. It was “serious” technology, created by experts for experts. In recent years, however, web-based visualizations — ranging from political art projects to news stories — have reached audiences of millions.
What will this new era of data transparency look like — and what are the implications for technologists who work with data? To help answer this question, I’ll discuss the future of visual literacy and what it means for a world where visualizations are a part of political discussions, citizen activism, game playing, and educational exchanges.

Amplifying Fan Experiences at Dallas Cowboys’ AT&T Stadium - Joel Beckerman, Founder and Lead Composer, Man Made Music, Gregg Heard, Vice President, Brand Identity and Design, AT&T, Travis Threlkel, Founder, Chief Creative Officer, Obscura Digital
In this session, hear how AT&T, Obscura Digital, and Man Made Music redefined fan experience at AT&T Stadium, home of the Dallas Cowboys.
Stadium sponsorships date back to 1972, but brands struggle with being relevant to these experiences today. With fans snapping and sharing, tweeting and tagging, AT&T has never been more relevant to the fan game day experience. But how do you show up in the game and stadium, not only in name but also in fan engagement?
This session explores technology and creative designed to make the AT&T Stadium a best-in-class fan experience including the innovative louvered screens designed by Obscura Digital and AT&T–ownable music and sound created by Man Made Music to elevate brand perception heard throughout the gme. From touchdown to interception, and first to fourth quarter, distinct visual and sonic assets were created for key moments to score the entire game experience.
Learn about innovations like the new AT&T Stadium app, which not only welcomes fans, but also guides their experience inside the gates visually and sonically. Most notably, the “Unite This House” in-game experience is an interactive, fan-driven moment in which, prompted by the app, fans power up a massive Cowboys’ star logo that appears on the stadium’s video screen growing in visual and sonic scale until it culminates in a multi-sensory explosion.
AT&T Stadium is one of the biggest “stages” in the world and larger-than-life activations mean big challenges. Learn about how AT&T, Obscura Digital, and Man Made Music worked to create Texas-sized emotion and experience for America’s Team.

Activated spaces & expressive environments - David Schwarz, Creative Partner, HUSH
We’re witnessing a digital / physical collapse. No longer opposing forces, we’re creating a handshake between what is made of bytes and what is as solid as wood or stone. Digital now comes before brick and mortar, not as an extension of it. Physical spaces integrated with technology are simultaneously self-aware and self-expressive. These spaces and places live in a delicate balance, challenging us by what’s known and what’s unknown, what’s static and what’s dynamic, what’s off and what’s on. They understand information as input, but can express brand artistry as output. We’re on the cusp of the truly activated space - one that dynamically swings between data collection (like sensors and inputs) and data expression (like content, sound and visualizations).
HUSH Creative Partner, David Schwarz, will show a few examples of how the design agency - specialists in designing experiences that tell stories across interaction, data and spaces - uses activated environments to cut through the chatter and engender the purest of impressions for its clients. With work for innovative brands as broad as Nike, Google and Equinox, the talk will showcase how HUSH takes complex brand challenges and solves them with highly designed experiences.
