#### 4A’s CreateTech:
######Nov 12- 13
######Microsoft NERD Center - Cambridge, MA

·      Meeting place for agency technologists, creatives and strategists.
·      Summit for presenting and discussing the great work and collaborations in creative experiences and communication design.
·      An opportunity to explore our the digital future with thought leaders, visionaries, leading-edge marketers and peers.

Organized by the advertising industry’s association, the 4A's, CreateTech’s annual gathering is a singular opportunity to focus on the dynamic interaction of technology and the industry’s creative disciplines.
For the past three years, CreateTech has been a leading event exploring the outer limits of digital creative and the changes technology has brought to the industry.

CreateTech’s theme for 2014 is: No edges: humans machines environments
Creativity and the internet of everything: New abilities, new interfaces, new design, new behaviors, new data. We’re exploring with the people working on the frontiers of our expanding digital lives.

CreateTech tackles investigates this theme in three ways:

“Ambient intelligence”: people, places, things
The starting point is the emerging internet of everything, an ever-more-connected world of people, places and things: Wearable technology; smart appliances; connected cars; homes and environments. Speakers will explore how individuals, technologists and brands will be dealing with new products, communication design for pervasive media and new personal and social behaviors and habits.

Applications: knowledge, skills, working together
The edges between disciplines in engineering, creative expression and media are breaking down. Data, automation, ubiquitous sensing and expressive devices are blurring the edges between all forms of interactive communications and media channels. And once hard edges of silo’ed expertise are blurring into collaborative practices, team structures and value exchange.  Dedicated sessions will grapple with the requirements and challenges of the new creative team; how to attract and hold top talent; how to plan for and reap excellence.

Our stories: client, agencies, consumers, ourselves
CreateTech tells great stories--from agencies, marketers, technologists and everyone--about the ways that digitally enabled physical and virtual environments are changing how we live, what we do and how we think and feel.

And, of course, CreateTech celebrates and highlights the work—inspiring, dazzling, far-reaching—born of these collaborations.

We are very pleased to be holding CreateTech in Boston the home of MIT MediaLab, the Harvard iLab,  a vibrant startup community and a city that is pioneering in it’s deployment of the internet of things.

4A’s CreateTech 2014: Pushing your ideas farther.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






The 4A's CreateTech conference is the meeting place where agency technologists, creatives and strategists explore the present and future opportunities in creative experience and communications design with thought leaders, visionaries, leading-edge marketers and their peers.

This year's theme is No edges: humans machines environments

No edges: ambient intelligence - People, Places and Things 
To starting point is the emerging internet of everything, a ever more connected world of people, places and things: wearable technology, smart appliances, connected cars, homes and environments. We're inviting speakers to explore how individuals, technologists and brands will be dealing with new designs and communications for pervasive media and new personal and social behaviors and habits.

No edges: knowledge, skills and working together
CreateTech is also about that how the edges between disciplines in engineering, creative expression, and communications design are breaking down. How data, automation, ubiquitous sensing and expressive devices are blurring the edges between all manner of interactive communications and media channels. New roles are emerging, now in all businesses, as the digital extensions of human activity are growing everyday. Once hard edges of silo'ed expertise are blurring into new collaborative practices, team structures and value exchange.

No edges: Our stories - client, agencies, consumers, our selves
CreateTech is about stories from agencies, marketers, technologists and everyone about how digitally enabled physical and virtual environments are changing how we live, what we do and how we think and feel.  

And, of course, CreateTech is about the inspirational creative work that results from 


4A’s CreateTech 2014 Pushing your ideas farther.


No edges, blurring edges, cross disciplinary innovation


#### Some topic development ideas

1. Data
	* More data allows us to create a fuller picture of personal contexts for services and messaging. What are the best ad experience designs for the world data science is now giving us?
	- Ad tech today is good business, but users/consumers, media companies and marketers feel there is a creativity gap. What are the most promising technologies and future directions that can bring great creative to mobile and new engagement contexts ?
	- How will the internet of things figure in this future?
	- As more objects we come into contact with in the course of our lives will be intelligent, expressive, sensing machines, how will this change an evolving media landscape?


2. Quantifed self, ubiquitous computing, intelligent space and the customer conversation

	- Looking at the potential future and some current experiments (See Boston article and  will services, products, brand experiences be delivered)
	- What are the most important emerging experience design principles to guide our strategies
	- Wearables have at least two dimensions, reporting the world to the wearer and then signaling and acting on those around them through recording, messaging, etc. What are some questions about  devices that do some of their work without the direct attention of the wearer, what are the feedback loops, the broader social impact, the design challenge?


3. Connected devices/environments
	- Cars, car as media channel, car as iPhone, interaction design and daily life, brand experience and driving, how important is the connection experience to car brand experience.
	- Connected appliances, what can we expect from the connected home and appliances
	-  Connective "tissue"; programming the internet of personal smart objects. Interoperability, data collections and aggregation, what are the upcoming consumer languages and tools?
	- Life and information in the Connected city


4. Virtual reality is a entire universe of connected and programmable things, including people!
	-  It also engages and empowers the body in new ways of interacting AND can also be connected to the physical world. 
	- There will be both physical and virtual interfaces to a connected world. What can we look forward to.?

4. Innovation/agile creativity: project roles and agency skills,
	- how are agencies retooling to produce more innovative work, sell it to clients, and participate in a new creative age driven by digital, 
	- how is "creative" being re-inventeed to include entrepreneurship, desing and programming beyond copywriting and art direction
	- how could user-centered design methodologies  used to model personas, behavior and contexts lead towards better creative systems. 


5. Many artists and musicians today are working with the tools of computing: algorithms, visualization, syntesized sound, interaction design and more. 
	- What can we learn from their advances and how have they contributed to some of the industries most stunning work?
	- What are the technologies now used by the Art&Code, DevArt to produce new age aesthetic experiences that might be relevant to these opportunities.
