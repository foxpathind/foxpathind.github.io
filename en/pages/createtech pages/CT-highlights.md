#10 Takeawys - Alison Cut
1.	Advanced technologies centered and AROUND? big data and analytics are allowing us to see a higher resolution picture of every day life. A holistic context awareness is the big opportunity
2.	Embrace the complexity and learn to manage it CAN BE COMBINED WITH NO. 1? 
3.	According by Cynthia - To communicate appropriately in a world of people and thinking things we will need to include the affective landscape of life relationships beyond mass media communIcations.
4.	**Soon living with technology will move off the screen into the entire built environment. EXAMPLES? LINK?**
5.	**Technology will allow us to engineer more personable tools and spaces. Brands will need to engage in even more trustworthy and contextually appropriate ways**
6.	**Personable things will engage our emotions even more deeply than mere storytelling. EXAMPLES? **
7.	**And we make better decisions when our emotions are engaged. COMBINE INTO NO. 6?** 
8.	When embracing doing the development themselves, agencies are learning to deal with the entrei experience design project life cycle. Moving from deliverables to continuous delivery methodologies
9.	David Shrier MIT Connection Science confirmed Deutsch LA's insights that face-to-face interaction develop deeper team bonds.
10.	Fernanda Viegas of Google showed us that how powerful it is to see the unseen with a data driven visualization of wind flows that sailors, firefighters and pilots found helpful
11.	UnderArmour and Mindshare showed us new wearable technology that will make collected personal data as easy as putting on a t-shirt.
12.	Nigel Jacob from Boston’s New Urban Mechanics reminds us that civic innovation whlps government build trust by surprising and delighting citizens as much as managing the budget.

##Takeaway @takeaway
>
- the sociology of a world of people and thinking things 
	- Demands an understanding of living relationships that will include technology-driven creatures
		- Broaden our perspective to look at the _affective landscape_ of relationships
		- There is a need to determine what are the authentic and clearly accepted bounds of relationship for each personal technology. Example of pets. "What can the creatue understand?" "human-like"
		- Trust will result from the experience and successful management of these relationships.  
		- Marketers, we need to become familiar with the facets of the interpersonal, 
		- Treating the design of "personalization" beyond a catalog of preferences (app specific, narrow, different dialects of preferences, vendor determined,) but of a trustworthy companionship that advocates for the user and is trustworthy because of the advocacy
		- App centric customization threatens to become an un-trustworthy, in-authentic by robbing @serendipity and discovery.
	- Thinking about technology needs to change from thinking about the personal to the interpersonal.
	- becoming "personal" elicits emotional response and that makes decision making better. @research_shows @personal
	- The nature of the engagement is determined by the object design, the signals it can give about it's motivations, understandings, intentions and attention. Both the software and hardware are involved.
	- "What is the experience we want to have?" - It's a bigger question when we our interactions become so much more personal
	- The key is that technolgy will enable the entire built environment becoming more "personable"  @personal @signals
	- We need to think more about creatures in the group. To be more "present" in a personal way, the technology has to get out of the way.
- Context awareness will be the big opportunity with big data @bigdata @context @complexity 
	- Josh on @context and example of image recognition of logos demonstrating how sensing a richer picture of the context in which life is led can reveal meaningful @signals of engagement, allegiance, loyalty, intention, trends etc.
	- Deep learning, <define> a @bigdata activity can help with determining appropriate intervention, messaging, service etc.
- Key concepts/terms
	- Deep learning, context, appropriateness, interpersonal (vs social), relationships, affective, affective landscape, emotional decision making, emotive computing, trust, advocate, agency

Digital technologies are more and more embedded in our lives, in the things we use, in the places we live, work and shop. And these technologies communicate with us and each other continually through networks growing like the living root system of a digital forest. A successful service or product in this evolving world is a combination of design and engineering arts and sciences that must leverage a deep understanding of human factors (behavioral, non-cognitive, physical and cultural) with a commitment to expertise with an increasingly capable and complex set of hardware and software systems that will embody the service or product.

it has become axiomatic today that only by partnering and collaborating with many different fields and practices, internally to externally, will it it be possible to build such services or products. But it is also only by bringing together of multiple mindsets in the most effective way will it be possible to be innovative and creative.

CreateTech aims once a year to bring those inspiring voices in design and engineering together with the technologists in advertising to help foster the cross disciplinary interchange that is necessary for our industry to be the best client partner and continually moving the agency business forward to meet the future.
