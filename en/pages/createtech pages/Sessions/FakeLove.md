####Topic Description Outline and how it fits into CreateTech2014

If you think of your favorite music, you already know that sound affects more than your eardrums. At its highest quality, sound creates a distinctly “synesthetic” experience. Synesthesia is a neurological phenomenon in which the stimulation of one sense elicits unique responses from all the other human senses. 

It is that phenomenon that inspired Fake Love in launching an experiential installation at the New York launch event for Master & Dynamic. To embody the high-end audio company's credo of "Sound is Creativity," and working closely with ad agency NSG/SWAT, Fake Love turned event visitors into bona fide “synesthetes,” creating a series of interactive sculptures to immerse consumers in a visual, tactile, and auditory fantasia. 

In this presentation, Josh Horowitz and Layne Braunstein, co-founders of Fake Love, will provide the audience with the key essentials of how to successfully implement a synesthetic experience for marketing efforts, as well as discussing the design process and future of synesthetic experiences. Key topics include:

* What marketers need to know about Synesthesia: how to combine the senses into an immersive experience to potentially turn audiences into bona fide "synesthetes" -- just as they did at the Master & Dynamic launch party. 
* How the unique geo-metal sculptures at the event offered visual variations on the familiar Master & Dynamic logo, and the challenges behind engaging the visitor's tactical and auditory senses to turn the digital into physical. 
* “Sound is Creativity": the creative process behind Fake Love's combination of sound, sight and touch that set the tone for the event's theme and focus and what brands need to know about engaging audiences using interactive techniques through this up-and-coming phenomenon. 

Fake Love's Synesthesia topic fits into the 2014 CreateTech theme because it incorporates the following elements:

* Environment: The combination of sounds and visuals created an experiential and interactive environment for participants.
* Humans: Fake Love used interaction to engage audiences at the Master & Dynamic event.
* Machines: The interactive sculptures created by Fake Love and Master & Dynamic's audio equipment encouraged participants to fully immerse themselves in the experience.
