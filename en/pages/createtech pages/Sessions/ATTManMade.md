Hi Chick,

Hope you're well. I wanted to share some additional information with you in regard to Man Made's work sonic work at Dallas Cowboys (AT&T) Stadium which delivers emotional impact at key moments in the fan/game experience. Hopefully this will provide a better sense of what I described in my email earlier this week. All this work is embargoed for now, so please don't pass around.

Please click HERE to access Man Made's wiredrive where you find several videos highlighting Man Made's work with AT&T Stadium. All the sounds and music you hear were created by Joel and his team at Man Made Music!

A guide to the videos and sonic:
- Videos 6 and 7- These two videos work hand-in-hand to demonstrate the interactive, fan-driven experience between the stadium, mobile app and fans.
	 * Video #7 is a rendition of the AT&T Stadium mobile app. Through fan participation the app will activate the pulsating Dallas Cowboys Star,  and a low hum that reverberates throughout the stadium will continue to intensify. 
	* Video #6 demonstrates that as fan participation and excitement builds, the AT&T sonic logo rings through the stadium and a sonic and visual frenzy engages the fans in the stadium as the star expands, pulsates, and then explodes. The track that plays is called "Unite This House" (by MMM)

- Videos 1, 2 and 5- will be used for in-game experiences (3rd down, 4th down and touchdown, respectively)
- Videos 3 and 4 - Crazy Train and Drumline- We internally cut together videos to showcase the audio. These tracks would always be played without visuals by the in-house DJ, when he feels the crowd warrants it.

I hope this helps clarify the design experience provided by Man Made and how their work enhanced the fan experience the moment they walk into the stadium gates!

If you'd like to discuss via phone, I'd be happy to walk you through it.

Thanks,
Pam

Hi Chick,

I'd love to talk further about this idea of design experience. Man Made Music is currently partnering with AT&T on new, innovative design experiences at AT&T/ Dallas Cowboy's Stadium which provides sonic experiences the minute guests enter the stadium gates, and includes a new stadium app and special interactivity between the app, the stadium and the fans. These new sounds and technology enhance and transform the stadium experience, while creating a feeling of loyalty to both the team and the brand!  We are finalizing a press release on this now and am happy to share with you shortly.

Additionally, Man Made Music has done work with AT&T in other environments include their flagship store in Chicago's Magnificent Mile and the upcoming College Football Hall of Fame in Atlanta.

Please let me know if you have any questions. I'm happy to jump on a call to discuss further.
