# “Hacking Reality: MIT Connection Science's Living Labs”
## David Shrier
In this eye-opening talk, MIT’s David Shrier will discuss the emergence of MIT's “Living Labs”, where innovations in changing human behavior are deployed in the real world with real people.  Transcending theory, these Living Labs grew out of the work of Professor Alex “Sandy” Pentland, the godfather of wearable computing and mentor to innovators creating breakthroughs such as Google Glass, Bluefin Labs (now part of Twitter), and Ginger.IO.
