#### CreateTech 2014 topic development ideas

1. Data
	* More data allows us to create a fuller picture of personal contexts for services and messaging. What are the best ad experience designs for the world data science is now giving us?
	- Ad tech today is good business, but users/consumers, media companies and marketers feel there is a creativity gap. What are the most promising technologies and future directions that can bring great creative to mobile and new engagement contexts ?
	- How will the internet of things figure in this future?
	- As more objects we come into contact with in the course of our lives will be intelligent, expressive, sensing machines, how will this change an evolving media landscape?


2. Quantifed self, ubiquitous computing, intelligent space and the customer conversation
	- Looking at the potential future and some current experiments (See Boston article and  will services, products, brand experiences be delivered)
	- What are the most important emerging experience design principles to guide our strategies
	- Wearables can have multiple dimensions, reporting the world to the wearer and then signaling and acting on those around them through recording, messaging, etc. What are the needed feedback loops, the broader social impact?
What are the design challenges and opportunities? 

3. Connected devices/environments
	- Car as media channel, car as iPhone, interaction design and daily life, brand experience and driving, how important is the connection experience to car brand experience.
	- Connected appliances, what can we expect from the connected home and appliances
	-  Connective "tissue"; programming the internet of personal smart objects. Interoperability, data collections and aggregation, what are the upcoming consumer languages and tools?
	- Life and information in the Connected city


4. Virtual reality is a entire universe of connected and programmable things, including people!
	-  It also engages and empowers the body in new ways of interacting AND can also be connected to the physical world. 
	- There will be both physical and virtual interfaces to a connected world. What can we look forward to.?

4. Innovation/agile creativity: project roles and agency skills,
	- how are agencies retooling to produce more innovative work, sell it to clients, and participate in a new creative age driven by digital, 
	- how is "creative" being re-inventeed to include entrepreneurship, desing and programming beyond copywriting and art direction
	- how could user-centered design methodologies  used to model personas, behavior and contexts lead towards better creative systems. 


5. Many artists and musicians today are working with the tools of computing: algorithms, visualization, syntesized sound, interaction design and more. 
	- What can we learn from their advances and how have they contributed to some of the industries most stunning work?
	- What are the technologies now used by the Art&Code, DevArt to produce new age aesthetic experiences that might be relevant to these opportunities.

###Note to Ben Malbon

We will also be exploring the intersection of technology and creativity in many ways and not only the internet of things.

One theme of the conference is that the internet of things will have an impact on design of communications the way that the ascendence of personal and personal mobile technology has had. Perhaps at least as much. So exploring many of the ways that “digital” is shaping creative is important and relevant. I like to think we try a push just a little harder outside our comfort zones at Createtech, to create a place for the already-tech-savvy to explore the possibilities and not only actualities.
