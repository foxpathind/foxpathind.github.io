# “Activated spaces & expressive environments”
## David Schwarz HUSH

We're witnessing a digital / physical collapse. No longer opposing forces, we're creating a handshake between what is made of bytes and what is as solid as wood or stone. Digital nows comes before brick and mortar, not as an extension of it. Physical spaces integrated with technology are simultaneously self-aware and self-expressive. These spaces and places live in a delicate balance, challenging us by what's known and what's unknown, what's static and what's dynamic, what's off and what's on. They understand information as input, but can express brand artistry as output. We're on the cusp of the truly activated space - one that dynamically swings between data collection (like sensors and inputs) and data expression (like content, sound and visualizations).

HUSH Creative Partner, David Schwarz, will show a few examples of how the design agency - specialists in designing experiences that tell stories across interaction, data, and spaces - uses activated environments to cut through the chatter and engender the purest of impressions for its clients. With work for innovative brands as broad as Nike, Google, and Equinox, the talk will showcase how HUSH takes complex brand challenges and solves them with highly designed experiences.
