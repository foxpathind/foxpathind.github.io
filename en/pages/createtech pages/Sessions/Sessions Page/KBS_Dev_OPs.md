#Development Operations for Creative Agencies
#Agency-style operations at startup-inspired scale

##kbs+ | Spies & Assassins


#Presentation

Those who work in the field of creative technology are used to fast-paced environments that see constant change — we know that the tools we use and the ways we will use them are continuously evolving every day. Our technology-focused agencies no longer build just microsites and promotional pages, but now often include the architecture, development, deployment, and continued maintenance of entire global websites and enterprise-scale web stacks. This usually means managing a variety of active projects across the team, often with overlapping schedules, and on a host of different technology stacks. How can we as an industry keep developing new creative works at this pace, yet continue to deliver the high-quality experiences that our clients and their users have come to expect?

Development Operations (commonly referred to as “DevOps”) is a concept that has been gaining mass adoption in the startup world over the past few years, and focuses on automating our infrastructure to scale up to handle enterprise-grade traffic while also continuously integrating code and configurations multiple times per day. Ultimately, it’s a way to ensure system stability, stack scalability, and overall human happiness, all while conserving resources.

In this talk, the kbs+ Spies & Assassins technology team will explain what DevOps is, what it means to our industry, and how you can take a big leap forward with these new tools and practices. We’ll include a quick tour of the relevant landscape, and show a few examples of how it’s proven invaluable for our own client projects.
