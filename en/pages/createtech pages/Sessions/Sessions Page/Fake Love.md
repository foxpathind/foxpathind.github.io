# “The Fine Line Between Art and Experiential Marketing”
## Fake Love

Fake Love’s founders, Josh Horowitz and Layne Braunstein, will speak about making art for art’s sake and how to use it to engage audiences when blurring the lines between the digital and physical. 

As art school grads who studied electronic media and digital animation, and cut their teeth working on TV commercials and broadcast promos, Josh and Layne will describe firsthand the key distinctions between trying to elicit emotional responses from people in a purely artistic vein, as opposed to influencing and affecting them on behalf of a product or a service. Their presentation will address:

* What critical elements of the creative process work (that can be easily transferred from the world of art to the world of experiential, interactive and digital) – and what elements don’t
* Key secrets to creating a successful arts-influenced, brand-sponsored experiential design project
* Top 5 most compelling questions that need to be addressed before embarking on either one of these endeavors
* Main differences and similarities between working for an artist and working for a brand manager or an ad agency
