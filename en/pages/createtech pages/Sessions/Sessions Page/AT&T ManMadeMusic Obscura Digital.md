# Amplifying Fan Experiences at Dallas Cowboys’ AT&T Stadium with Sonic Enhancements
## Man Made Music, AT&T & Obsura Digital

In this session, hear how AT&T, Obscura Digital, and Man Made Music redefined fan experience at AT&T Stadium, home of the Dallas Cowboys.
Stadium sponsorships date back to 1972, but brands struggle with being relevant to these experiences today. With fans snapping and sharing, tweeting and tagging, AT&T has never been more relevant to the fan game day experience. But how do you show up in the game and stadium, not only in name but also in fan engagement?
This session explores technology and creative designed to make the AT&T Stadium a best-in-class fan experience including the innovative louvered screens designed by Obscura Digital and AT&T–ownable music and sound created by Man Made Music to elevate brand perception heard throughout the gme. From touchdown to interception, and first to fourth quarter, distinct visual and sonic assets were created for key moments to score the entire game experience.Learn about innovations like the new AT&T Stadium app, which not only welcomes fans, but also guides their experience inside the gates visually and sonically. Most notably, the “Unite This House” in-game experience is an interactive, fan-driven moment in which, prompted by the app, fans power up a massive Cowboys’ star logo that appears on the stadium’s video screen growing in visual and sonic scale until it culminates in a multi-sensory explosion.
AT&T Stadium is one of the biggest “stages” in the world and larger-than-life activations mean big challenges. Learn about how AT&T, Obscura Digital, and Man Made Music worked to create Texas-sized emotion and experience for America’s Team.-----

In this session hear how Man Made Music, Obsura Digital and AT&T helped redefine the concept of fan experience at AT&T Stadium, home of the Dallas Cowboys.  

Learn about environment activation innovations like the new AT&T Stadium app, which not only welcomes fans to the game, it also guides their experience inside the gates visually and sonically. Most notably, the “Unite This House” in-game experience is an interactive, fan-driven moment in which, prompted by the app, fans power up a massive Cowboys’ star logo that appears on the stadium’s video screen. Rising with the level of fan participation, a low hum reverberates throughout the stadium. As the excitement builds, and the AT&T sonic logo rings through the stadium, a sonic and visual frenzy engages the fans in the stadium as the star expands, pulsates, and then explodes. 

Other advancements at AT&T Stadium demonstrating new ways to activate social spaces include: 
•	The “Augmented Reality” guided tour, another feature of the AT&T Stadium app for which Man Made Music utilizes the power of sound to guide fans around the stadium.
•	The introduction of large louvered screens designed by Obscura Digital showing a combination of AT&T content and Cowboys plays – for example, touchdowns or interceptions with distinct Cowboys music moments– and fan-submitted selfies. 
•	The “Fanboard with AT&T UFX,” an interactive touchscreen that lets fans learn about all-things Cowboys, assisted by Man Made Music’s sonic navigation.
•	User interface and brand navigation sounds in the AT&T Stadium app that score the fan experience.
