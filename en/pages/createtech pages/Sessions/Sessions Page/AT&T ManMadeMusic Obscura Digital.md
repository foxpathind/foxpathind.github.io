# Amplifying Fan Experiences at Dallas Cowboys’ AT&T Stadium with Sonic Enhancements
## Man Made Music, AT&T & Obsura Digital
In this session hear how Man Made Music, Obsura Digital and AT&T helped redefine the concept of fan experience at AT&T Stadium, home of the Dallas Cowboys.  

Learn about environment activation innovations like the new AT&T Stadium app, which not only welcomes fans to the game, it also guides their experience inside the gates visually and sonically. Most notably, the “Unite This House” in-game experience is an interactive, fan-driven moment in which, prompted by the app, fans power up a massive Cowboys’ star logo that appears on the stadium’s video screen. Rising with the level of fan participation, a low hum reverberates throughout the stadium. As the excitement builds, and the AT&T sonic logo rings through the stadium, a sonic and visual frenzy engages the fans in the stadium as the star expands, pulsates, and then explodes. 

Other advancements at AT&T Stadium demonstrating new ways to activate social spaces include: 
•	The “Augmented Reality” guided tour, another feature of the AT&T Stadium app for which Man Made Music utilizes the power of sound to guide fans around the stadium.
•	The introduction of large louvered screens designed by Obscura Digital showing a combination of AT&T content and Cowboys plays – for example, touchdowns or interceptions with distinct Cowboys music moments– and fan-submitted selfies. 
•	The “Fanboard with AT&T UFX,” an interactive touchscreen that lets fans learn about all-things Cowboys, assisted by Man Made Music’s sonic navigation.
•	User interface and brand navigation sounds in the AT&T Stadium app that score the fan experience.
