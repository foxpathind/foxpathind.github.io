BSSP forced to more integrated to outpunch their weight - lurching to find the capability, questing. How do we put it together. Bring back the pragmatic aspect, how do I win new business. Talk about BSSP determine relevance by context.  

As we take a look at the increasing ubiquity of intelligent data gathering and realtime contextual analysis, where should we begin to look for how to design brand experiences. Should they become more service oriented versus message oriented. What can the fields of user-centered product and service design tech marketers about how to craft holistic brand experience strategies to deepen connections.

That sounds great!  I know Byron is keenly interested in wearable tech, in particular.  Plus—and this is just spit-balling here—I think there’s something to be said about how creatives should be thinking about (and, ultimately, harnessing) the plethora of user data the Internet of everything is going to create.  I’ve seen a few people in the space talking about it—Amy Gershkoff, Mark Himmelsbach et al.—but think it’s an undertold story.  

Anyhoo—here’s Byron’s bio and a few speaking clips I pulled from YouTube, in case you’re interested.  

Byron Ellis is CTO of Spongecell, where he heads research and development. Prior to Spongecell, Byron served as Chief Data Scientist for LivePerson, a company that helps businesses engage in real-time customer communications. Byron also held various leadership positions at AdBrite, eventually serving as the company’s CTO. Byron holds a PhD in Statistics from Harvard University and was a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford Medical School. Byron earned a BS in Cybernetics from UCLA.
