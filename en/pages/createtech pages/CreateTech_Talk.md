Imagination and the made world
with the digital we don't leave the made world behind
the anxiety when the made world takes on agency
motion at a distance
decision makign at a distance
distributed and shared, too much for one mind to control
we are sharing the world 
it is still up to us and our imaginations to see through our own creations and behaviors and work the contexts environments and levers of the connected world
to understand the levers of the connected world
where our feelings and needs have determined the shape and actions of these things 
and now with their own dynamics and power their own actions and behaviors we lose a clear sense of the distinctions
but still have the power to understand our selves and where we are likely to be headed and what concepts and tools we'll need to live into 
ImaginTion to understand the world that is coming into being and how we want to construct experiences in that world 
Not just goal determined entertainment or storytelling.
Imagination to see the possiblities
To widen our view of how the world is made and what constitutes value experience and engagement worth our time.
