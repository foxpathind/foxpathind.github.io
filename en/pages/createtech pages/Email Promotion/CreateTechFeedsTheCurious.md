##CreateTech: Feed the curious mind
### Brand Building and the Internet of Things ###


The Internet of Things will bring as much radical change to our lives as the personal computer and mobile phone.  Intelligence, communication and intention will now flow between people, things and the environment. As new kinds of relationships emerge, new brands (and new ways to build them) will evolve.

At CreateTech 2014, speakers will explore the interactive and expressive possibilities of a world where live intelligent objects and places participate. Hear from Dr. Cynthia Braezeal, creator of [Jibo, the first family robot](myjibo.com). David Shrier will present [MIT Connection Science's Living Labs,](http://video.mit.edu/watch/connection-science-12875/)
 "where innovations in changing human behavior are deployed in the real world with real people"

CreateTech not only brings outside perspectives, we also engage your passions on the inside. Fellow creative technologists—our peers—gather to discuss what matters most in our work.

Sessions include "The evolution of the creative technologist" by [Sheldon Montiero, SapientNitro's CTO](www.linkedin.com/in/sheldonmonteiro), and renewed for another season, "Agency Innovation Labs" with [Mark Logan, SVP Digital Innovation, Barkley](www.linkedin.com/in/marklogan) and [Michael Phillips, Director of Digital and Creative Technology, Eleven](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelpaulphillips)
