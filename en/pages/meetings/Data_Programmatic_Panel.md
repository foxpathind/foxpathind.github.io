### Myths and Realities ###

- Using data
	- Jet blue
		- CRM
		- Customer services
		- Pricing is dynamic
		- Filling seats
	- our questions
		- Value to jetblue
		- how price sensitive are you
	- we think of programmatic as simply automation
		- more complex rules
		- 30% programmatic
		- still want relationships the other 70%
		- very little off line
	- questions
		- competition
			- 
		- measurement
			- 1st party data is my customer
				- customer scoring
				- can't match yet to targeting in media
			- 3rd party targeting not the same
	- Broadway Michele Groner
		- Shows and audiences
		- Budgets limited
		- How models
		- we don't own the ticketing data
		- Telecharge and CableVision
			- model for us a TV buy
			- looked like the agency model 
			- BUT some surprises
				- ESPN
				- BUT household or the ticket buyer?
	- Cablevision TV prgrammtic
		- Digital progammatic is different
		- operationally collected data then created a methodology
			- automate
				- automate the right processes
				- scale
				- run it long enough to surface issues
			- Need the data to automate
				- timely - max 24/48 hours
				- quality, clean and authenticated
				- reliable, multiple sources
				- Collect the census, all the data, all users
					- deidentifying
				- Create segments
					- minivans, sedans, for instance
					- Blind match with Experian
					- Propensity models
				- Set top media model
					- time
					- programming
			- We watch the performance
				- Match conversations
	- JetBlue - Data
		- Our existing 1st party data is the most valuable
	- Broadway
		- Pricing is so important
		- We were telling $400 customers that they could have seen it at $30
		- 60% from outside tristate
		- But we can't afford ads outside with any given location would  be small
		- Programmatic MIGHT allow us to reach specific locations
		- People DO mobile research
	- Cablevision
		- Data is telling us the audiences and the programs are best to get that audience
		- (Profiles)
		- The buy - Audience, flight and price, not which program we work the automated
			- (What about inventory against the audience, auction?)
	- Location
		- geo
		- screens
		- JetBlue - location is very important of course
			- have to include
			- origin and destination
		- Question: role of mobile
			- Tablets versus smart phone
				- content different and activities
	- Questions
		- Privacy and Security
			- Alignment of sources was important
			- Lots 
			- Cablevision: technically, operationally
				- All PII dropped at collection
				- Aggregated, deidentified at house
				- KPMG audited - compliance
				- Cant be valuable
			- Eric
				- PII dropped
				- everything hashed
				- we don't know
			- JetBlue
				- what's ethical?
				- we're regulated
				- other wanted our cookie data
				- we will see more regulation
		- Fraudulent Traffic
			- JetBlue 
				- agency does the auditing
				- we're moving to a trading desk to work with the DSPs
				- honestly you work it into the calculations, always been there
			- Radium One
				- Our performance would suffer
				- We audit
				- Look for performance
