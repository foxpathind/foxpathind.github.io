Article in the times about the advances in green technology in Germany demonstrate very clearly and at scale as we like to say how techology even well intentioned, even when the impact is positive, is moving faster than humans can manage. 

Here the sustained effort to create altenative energy sources has produced stunning results but at a cost to existing economic and industrial infratructures that are not easily reconceived, remapped and reformed to produce a seamless benefit to society. The internet of things, the article goes on to say, the ability energy consuming appliances to manage themselves, will play a large part in helping communities work with a new energy delivery infrastructure.

But as another study done recently at the Wharton School [2] points out:

> Practical challenges are the ones likely to be solved soonest. The primary practical issue to emerge from the conference on “Sustainability in the Age of Big Data,” hosted by Wharton’s Initiative for Global Environmental Leadership (IGEL), is, ironically, a lack of brainpower.

> As Paul Rogers, chief development officer at GE, said in his closing presentation at the IGEL conference, “Big Data exists today in a way that is extremely difficult to understand.” Since much of the Industrial Internet data is specific to particular types of machinery, it is often intelligible only to those who designed and built the equipment. It takes deep expertise to use such data to solve problems and find efficiencies. And it requires the additional expertise of computer scientists and others to create software that can render such data useful to non-experts in the future.

> The immediate concern is that there simply are not enough experts—engineers, Big Data analysts and computer scientists — to cope with the huge amount of data that is rapidly accumulating.
 



Jeremy Rifkin [1] calls the sum of these technology advances a Third Industrial Revolution to express the global impact the reach and pace of development will have on the future. And while Rifkin looks primarily at all the potential positive consequences this will have for our future,
the institutions we have created to provide for our basic needs [Maslow], of all kinds, from subsistence, to the application of justice and fair treatment, to commercial success and self esteem can be thrown out of balance by even a positive development.

The success story of renewable energy in Germany will alert us to the great challenges ahead in reaching this possible future.
